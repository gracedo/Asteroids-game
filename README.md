# Asteroids

(JavaScript)

This game implements a moving ship (move by up/down/left/right arrow buttons) that can shoot bullets (spacebar) at moving asteroids of different sizes. The game ends and restarts when the ship collides with an asteroid.

The background changes randomly at every reload of the game!
